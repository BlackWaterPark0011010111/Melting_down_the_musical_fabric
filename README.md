# Melting_down_the_musical_fabric

under construction 

"Melting_down_the_musical_fabric" is a program I’m developing to convert sheet music into tabs and vice versa. It works with images and PDF files: you upload a picture of sheet music or tabs, the program recognizes them using OCR technology, and converts them into the desired format — sheet music into tabs for guitarists, or tabs back into sheet music.
All data is saved in a PostgreSQL database, so users can store their results and access them later. The Django-based web interface makes it easy to upload files, manage conversions, and save results.
I'm still working on the code and plan to improve it with more features in the future — for example, adding the ability to edit sheet music and tabs online. The project is still in development, and I’ll be continuously refining and updating it.
